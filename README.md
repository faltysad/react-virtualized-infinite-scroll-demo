# 📜 react-virtualized-infinite-scroll-demo
This is a simple showcase of performant infinite-scroll experience
using react-virtualized. This example handles infinite-scroll based on
window scroll position, which gives us the ability to create
"newsfeed-like" infinite-scroll layouts. In this example, as the user
scrolls, we fetch data about trending repositories from the GitHub
API.
