# react-virtualized-infinite-scroll-demo
          This is a simple showcase of performant infinite-scroll experience           using react-virtualized. This example handles infinite-scroll based on           window scroll position, which gives us the ability to create           "newsfeed-like" infinite-scroll layouts. In this example, as the user           scrolls, we fetch data about trending repositories from the GitHub           API.
